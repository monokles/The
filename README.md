Humans have entered your lair, and now you can't sleep! Chase them off but be careful not to kill them. You might be a monster but you're not a murderer!

My first LD entry ever (and first game, and first soundtrack, lots of firsts here):D
* Game made in javascript / html, using Vim and Atom, and the node http server for live editing.
* Graphics: Aseprite v1.0.9-dev
* Sounds: sfxr for effects, milkytracker for music (What a pain to figure out the keybinds for that program wow)

--Jquery is linked from the web page, but I only included it out of laziness, so I don't have to type document.getElementById all the time. No actual Jquery features are used.
